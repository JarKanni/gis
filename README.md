#### Description
Underground Storage Tank leak risk assessment for residential water wells.  USTs may contain chemicals toxic to nearby life which may leak due to long term degredation.  Tasked with counting how many local residential water wells (blue dots) may be at risk to future leaks using a Buffer in QGIS.  Transformed coordinates of water wells and UST sites to match same coordinate system.

- Underground Storage Tanks (yellow diamonds)
- Buffer zones (yellow transparent circles)
- Water wells (blue circles)
